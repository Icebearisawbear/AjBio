  <h4 class="text4">
    Hi, I’m AJ! I’m a huge fan of gaming, and one of my favorite things to do is play Valorant with my friends. It’s more than just a game for me—it’s a way to connect, compete, and have a great time with my team. I also love streaming on Twitch every now and then. Sharing my gaming sessions and interacting with viewers is such a fun and rewarding experience.
Right now, I’m in college, working hard to build a solid foundation for my future. My dream job is to become an IT engineer, where I can combine my passion for technology with my problem-solving skills to create innovative solutions. I’ve always been fascinated by the way technology shapes our world, and I’m excited to be part of the future in that field.
One project I’m really proud of is the work I did alongside my friends, Thaniel and Rhy. Together, we coded websites for our premier Valorant team. It was an awesome experience to combine our technical skills with our shared love for gaming. It taught me the importance of teamwork, creativity, and perseverance—values that drive me in everything I do.
